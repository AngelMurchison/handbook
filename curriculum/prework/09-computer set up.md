## Get your Computer ready


"A good craftsmans knows his tools". This is double so for software developers. Follow the steps to prepare your computer for the course. As a rule of thumb, if your computer has a CD drives, its too old for the course and an update is needed

** Reach out to me on Slack or email if you get stuck here!!!**

## Dev environment

The suggested computer for students is an Apple MacBook Pro laptop less than two years old.
Minimum requirements:
- 8GB of RAM
- 500GB HDD
- macOS High Sierra (10.13)
or Windows 10, subject to approval (see below)

_Why a Mac?_ All of our students being on the same platform enables us to move at a much
quicker pace. Processes like setting up new tools experience reduced friction because the
same workflows apply to everyone.

Additionally, The open source and web development communities are invested in tools and
libraries that work best with POSIX based operating systems like UNIX, Linux, and Appleâ€™s
macOS (BSD Unix). In short, we believe using the macOS best prepares our students to work in
the web development industry.

Students who choose to study .NET development with us may also find substantial benefit
from using macOS. A PC laptop can be approved for class use on a case by case basis during
the interview process.

### Slack 

We will be using Slack extensively throughout the cohort and beyond, It is highly recommended to download the app for your laptop and (if you have one) for your smart phone. 

Head over here to download it: https://slack.com/downloads

#### Install Visual Studio Code

For the first part of the program, we will learning various front end technologies. These languages are best used from a light weight editor. Visual Studio Code is Microsoft's new lightweight text editor. It is a powerful IDE (integrated development environment) that offers an outstanding tool set, while staying out of your way. 

Download it here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

BONUS CHALLENGE: As developers, we love the command line. We always try to find ways to better utilize the power of the command line. So as a bonus, try to set your environment to open VS Code from the command line by typing the command:

``` 
code . 
```

### Mac Setup

#### HomeBrew

#### Node & Yarn


### Windows 10

#### Powershell

As developers, you will be using a vareity of IDE (code editors) through out your career. But, one constant is the terminal. One Windows, there are 2 different terminals, Command Line and PowerShell. We will be using Powershell. This will let you control your PC by typing commands. To enhance the Powershell, you will should install a plug in called [Posh-Git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git#installing-posh-git-via-powershellget). This will be the hardest thing to install


#### Node & Yarn


#### Install Git

Git is the version control we will be using for source code during the class. It helps developers handle changes to the source code. 

There are many Git clients but they all use the underlying system that needs to be installed from [here](https://git-scm.com/)

Make sure it gets added to your path. To test that this installed correctly, open up powershell and "git". You should see a list of options. If it says "Command not found", then it is not installed correctly
