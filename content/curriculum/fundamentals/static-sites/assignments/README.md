title: What's in a Hobby?

This multi-day project will have you building a personal web-site about a hobby you enjoy, or maybe, one that you
would like to learn.

This could be a showcase, or a tutorial, etc.

## Phase 1 - Hello, World.

* Create a single-page website with valid, well-formed, markup
* Push the source code to GitHub
* Publish the page on the web

## Phase 2

* Basic CSS applied type and colors. Valid, well-formed CSS included via `<link>` tag. It should include at least three
  images.
* Add 1-2 more pages, linking to them with navigation that is continuous across each page.

## Phase 3

Create a responsive layout for your page and add considerable polish.
