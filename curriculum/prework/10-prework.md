# Prework

Prework is material that ensures you have the basic foundation required for the course. Starting learning before the program is like training for a marathon. You don't show up the day of the race and start, you need to train beforehand. In our program, your brain is the muscle that needs to train. This prework is training for your brain.

## Fundamentals and Front End Development

### Learn some basic HTML and CSS \(choose one of the following\)

Start off with some HTML and CSS. HTML and CSS are the essentially what everything boils down to. This is what the user will see and interact with the most. This is the best place to get your feet wet.

### Intro to JavaScript & React

JavaScript is an key language to learn in creating web sites. We will be doing a deep dive into the language at the beginning of the program because it is easy for beginners to pick up. React is a widely used Front-end Framework that allows developers to easily work with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Back end Focus

### Explore C\# \("c-sharp"\) & .NET 

.NET is a powerful framework built by Microsoft. This is an extremely popular, flexible and ubiquitous language. If this takes up all of your time, that is okay, just get as far as you can. If you have extra time, move onto the other languages. The further you push yourself before class, the less jarring the course will be.
