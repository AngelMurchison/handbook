# How to Ask Questions

First, it should be stated that there are no _bad_ questions, only gaps in knowledge you're looking to fill.

### Tips

* If you're stuck, don't bang your head against the desk for too long. Reach out for help.
* Make sure you are using the resources around you. Your peers, the Internet, the community are all available in addition to your instructor / mentor.
